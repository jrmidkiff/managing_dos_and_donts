# Managing Do's & Don'ts

## Do's
* Meet with subordinates individually once per week
* Be prepared for any meeting with a subordinate with what they need to begin working right out of the meeting
* Solicit fairly sourced feedback
    * Ask people if they thought a meeting was necessary 
* Thoroughly use a project tracking software; be the example!
    * Either make subordinates use it, or don't let them. Either way just stick to one
* Have established written processes for things for people to refer back to
* Have established trainings for new hires
* Have regularly scheduled happy hours / lunches
* Encourage launching to production tomorrow or next week rather than launching to production this evening
* Encourage people to leave work early if they have accomplished something major.
* Eat lunch in a publicly available space as often as possible
* Schedule meetings with your subordinates before taking extended time off
* Show up to meetings exactly on time and ready (esp. audio/video for meetings), or preferably even early
* Clearly delineate who on your team is responsible for what


## Don'ts
* Make people attend meetings if they don't have to or won't specifically benefit
* Do standups for no reason
* Take more than three minutes to talk about your projects
* Go on tangents
* Make your subordinates wait around with nothing to do because you're busy working on something else
    * Your work may get delayed a half-hour, but you just moved up your subordinate's efficiency by a full day
* Take days off without telling your subordinates well ahead of time
